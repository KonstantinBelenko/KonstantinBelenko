## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Konstantin. I really like tech, and building things.

Some of the things I've built:
1. Low-level compiler with custom backend for apple arm processors in zig: [Garbage](https://github.com/0xfaa/Garbage)
2. Visual debugger for small ARM assembly apps: [VizWiz](https://vizwiz.netlify.app/)
3. 2D cloth simulation in pure JS: [No name yet lol](https://lambent-pixie-ced146.netlify.app/)

I also really like networking, and game-development. Every time one of my firends has a birthday, I make a small game for them.
