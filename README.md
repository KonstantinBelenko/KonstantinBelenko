## Hi

My name is Konstantine. I like to build stuff. My favorite things are networking, compilers, and shipping web apps.

Some of the things I've built (not up to date tho):
1. Low-level compiler with custom backend for apple arm processors in zig: [Garbage](https://github.com/0xfaa/Garbage)
2. Visual debugger for small ARM assembly apps: [VizWiz](https://vizwiz.netlify.app/)
3. 2D cloth simulation in pure vanilla JS: [No name yet lol](https://lambent-pixie-ced146.netlify.app/)
